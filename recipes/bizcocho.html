    <img src="../img/spongecake2.jpg">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>150g (3/4 cup) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>60ml (1/4 cup) milk/li>
        <li>60ml (1/4 cup) vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Optional: zest of 1 lemon or orange for added flavor</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven and Prepare Pan:</li>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F).
            Grease and line the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment paper. You can also use a non-stick baking spray.
        </p>
        <li>Prepare Dry Ingredients:</li>
        <p>In a bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.
        </p>
        <li>Beat Egg Yolks:</li>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until the mixture is thick, pale, and forms a ribbon when the beaters are lifted. This should take about 5 minutes.  
        </p>
        <li>Add Wet Ingredients:</li>
        <p>Add the milk, vegetable oil (or melted butter), and vanilla extract to the egg yolk mixture. Mix on low speed until well combined.
        </p>
        <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</li>
        <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
        </p>
        <li>Bake:</li>
        <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
        </p>
        <li>Cool:</li>
        <p>Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.
            Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake, then invert it onto a wire rack to cool completely.
        </p>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <p>Once the cake is completely cooled, you can serve it as is, or dust it with powdered sugar for a simple decoration.
            You can also frost it with your favorite frosting or whipped cream.
        </p>
    </ol>
